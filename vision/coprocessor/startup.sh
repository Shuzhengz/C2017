# This script runs vision and all the things vision needs:
# * Set camera parameters - minimum exposure and brightness
# * Run vision
#
# Usage: startup.sh roborio-ip
#
# To run this on startup, add the following line or something similar to /etc/rc.init
#
#     /home/ubuntu/robot-code/c2017/vision/coprocessor/startup.sh 10.16.78.22 >& /home/ubuntu/log.text &
#

# This line is necessary because for some reason, I don't know exactly why, everything has
# a high probability of breaking horribly for strange reasons when it isn't here. You
# might think "oh, this line seems sketchy, and I deleted it and it seemed to work."
# Well yes, it is sketchy, and if you delete it things work sometimes, but it will be a lot
# of pain when we get 10 different bugs in the vision code and need to re-discover that
# this is necessary. It might make you cry, and it makes me cry too, but just trust me,
# don't delete it. Seriously, git blame exists and we will find you.
